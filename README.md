# Micropolar_PDDO_Code
The repository is for implementing fracture behavior of micropolar continuum with peridynamic differential operator method.

This program includes how the  PDDO function is obtained and how the horizon is searched in a fast way. The implementation of micropolar elasticity with Peridynamic differential operator method is presented, which originates from my previously published paper:

_Wan, J., Yang, D., Chu, X., & Qu, W. (2022). A micropolar peridynamic differential operator and simulation of crack propagation. Engineering Fracture Mechanics, 269, 108532._

The stationary crack propagation is shown in the numerical example "main_pddo_micropolar.m".
Postprocessing is performed with m-files whose names are prefixed with "post_"
An example of how to perform PDDO derivatives is given in "main_pddo_derivative.m"
